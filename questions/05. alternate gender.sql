🧾 SQL Problem Statement
Question:
Given a table named student_details, write a query to display student names alternately by gender, starting with either, and sorted by the ascending order of the id column.

📂 Table Structure – students table
Column	Type	Description
id	INTEGER (Primary Key)	Student ID
name	VARCHAR(50)	Student Name
gender	CHARACTER (likely 'M'/'F')	Gender of Student

🎯 Output Requirement
Display names alternating by gender (e.g., M → F → M → F or F → M → F → M …).

Final result must be sorted by ID in ascending order internally before alternating.

Output should contain at least the name column (and optionally id, gender if needed for debugging).
