ðŸ§¾ SQL Problem Statement
Question:
Given a table named student_details, write a query to display student names alternately by gender, starting with either, and sorted by the ascending order of the id column.

ðŸ“‚ Table Structure â€“ students table
Column	Type	Description
id	INTEGER (Primary Key)	Student ID
name	VARCHAR(50)	Student Name
gender	CHARACTER (likely 'M'/'F')	Gender of Student

ðŸŽ¯ Output Requirement
Display names alternating by gender (e.g., M â†’ F â†’ M â†’ F or F â†’ M â†’ F â†’ M â€¦).

Final result must be sorted by ID in ascending order internally before alternating.

Output should contain at least the name column (and optionally id, gender if needed for debugging).
